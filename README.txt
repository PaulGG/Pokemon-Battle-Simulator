Welcome to Pokemon Battle Simulator!

YOU NEED TO INSTALL PYGAME AS A DEPENDENCY.

pip install pygame

A few basics of the game as there are no in-game tutorials:

In a Pokemon battle, you have the option to fight, switch pokemon, and use an item.

Every pokemon must have at least 2 moves and can have up to 4.

Every move is either Physical/Special, and has a pokemon type to go along with it.

Every pokemon has at least one type and can have two types. These types are:

Normal
Fighting
Flying
Poison
Ground
Rock
Bug
Ghost
Steel
Fire
Water
Grass
Electric
Psychic
Ice
Dragon
Dark
Fairy

Pokemon have stats:
HP
Attack
Defense
Special Attack
Special Defense
Speed

These all determine how much health the pokemon has (how much damage it CAN take), 
its attack damage, its defense (how much damage it takes), the special variants of 
those, and then speed (will player or enemy attack first?)

Items are in the shop. The main categories are potions and revives. 
The more expensive the item is, the more it will heal you.
